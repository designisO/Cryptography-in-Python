# Cryptography 101

In this project, I wanted to gain knowledge about the cryptography library for Python. The goal in this project is to learn how to use keys to encrypt and decrypt a secret message using a key. The key is a private key which shouldn't be shared unless wanting to decrypt. Decided to use jupyter notebook to show the code in cells as they are executed.


## Terminology
Fernet -is an implementation of symmetric (also known as “secret key”) authenticated cryptography.

## Usage

```python
pip install cryptography

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
```
